Interviewer: I have with me Norah. She's a famed scientist. We're here to talk about some various Lepidoptera and I would like to hear a little bit about you. Would you please tell the audience a little bit of something about Norah.

Norah: Well I really like animals and insects and other stuff like that and I really don't like habitat loss or pollution or poaching and stuff like that.

Q: How long have you been interested in science?
A: Since I can remember, pretty much everything has to do with science so if you're interested in anything then it pretty much has science connected with it.

Q: What are some of the favorite butterflies that you've caught recently?
A: One of the ones I've never actually seen in person before was a snout nose butterfly and that was cool as I never caught or seen it before and you can check out my Nature Naturalist episode on that.

Thanks for coming by today I'm gonna go in and update your about page with that information.

Norah: Bye. Thank you for visiting our website!
